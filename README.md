Small snake game, with simple graphics, that works on CMD. Get points, get big, and dont lose.

## System Requirements

Because of the way this game was coded it will only work on **Windows systems** for now. Main objective for the next versions is getting the game to work in all devices.

There is also a minimum screen size. You will need at least a screen with **800x600** screen size.

## Installation

To install the game go to [realeases](https://github.com/Atalachy/SBSnake/releases/tag/v1.0) and install the binary.

This game will be new in your pc, so windows will try to stop it from running. Go to **more info** in the smart screen and then press **run anyways**

- **Fast** - In this mode, your snake will move so fast that you dont even have time to blink. Hardest difficulty.
- **Caffeine Addiction** - Fun gamemode for a people that like a challange, in this mode the snake will get faster the more points you get!

Size:
- **Small** - Smallest game size, you will need some glasses to play with this size.
- **Normal** - Default size, not too big, not too small.
- **Big** - A big map, takes sometime to get from one side to another. Might cause some bugs in smaller screens!

Modes:
- **Walls** - Look out for the walls, you will lose if you touch them
- **No Walls** - Pacman style, get to the other side by going through walls, but look out, you can still lose if you hit yourself.
- **Blocks** - Walls, you and now blocks? What else can make you lose? Look out for the blocks that spawn randomly.

## Difference between CMDs

Windows Terminal | Classic CMD

Last Block of the tail is the darkest block and can be only noticed in the Windows Terminal version.
Some design things, like blinking cursor or grey colors, cannot be seen in the CMD and PowerShell version.
